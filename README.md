# oomps/oomtables

Command-line Python programs to configure/control the Linux Out-Of-Memory (OOM) Killer.

* **oomps:** Like `ps` or `top`, but for per-process memory usage & Linux OOM Score.
* **oomtables:** Rules-based control of the Linux Out-Of-Memory (OOM) Killer
  (inspired by ye olde Linux `iptables`, but with syntax more like `if`-statements in C
  or functions in Shell).
